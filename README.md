# Overview
This guide aims to fully describe how to download and merge Refinitiv (formerly Datastream) Worldscope data into one dataset. 

# Motivation
Empirical databases such as Compustat provide a fully structured dataset of stock quoted firms. However, the Compstat access may be costly for some institutions. Refinitiv Eikon offers an unstructured alternative. Because of the lack in structure, different individuals may result in different Worldscope datasets which limits the reproducability of studies. Therefore, this repository is a proposition on how to download and merge Worldscope data via the Refinitiv Eikon Excel Add-in. 

# Requirements
To access the Refinitv Eikon database, your institution needs to have an account.
