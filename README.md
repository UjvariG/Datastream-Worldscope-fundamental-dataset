# Data Requests to rawData
This guide aims to fully describe how to download and merge Refinitiv (formerly Datastream) Worldscope data into one dataset. 

# Motivation
Empirical databases such as Compustat provide a fully structured dataset of stock quoted firms. However, the Compstat access may be costly for some institutions. Refinitiv Eikon offers an unstructured alternative. Because of the lack in structure, different individuals may result in different Worldscope datasets.
